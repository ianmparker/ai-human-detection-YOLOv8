# Overview

This repository contains a YOLO model trained on a dataset of human images.

I have attatched examples of the model at work below. 

  - The first of which was from the 2024 NESBE Conference (file was too big to put in GitHub)
  - The second uses footage from a busy Times Square in New York.
